# Description
This is a Goodreads inspired website. I build it with React.js, CSS, JavaScript, Google Books Api, and Firebase. Users can sign up with an email and password, and search for their favortie books. They can save their books to their specific profile. 

# Design in Figma
I created the ui in Figma, I used Adobe Photoshop to manipulate assets to be compatabile with the website. Here's a photos of the figma project:
